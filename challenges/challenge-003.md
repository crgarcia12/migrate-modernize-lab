# Analyze Migration Data and Build a Business Case

## Goal 

Transform Azure Migrate discovery data into insights by fixing data quality issues, grouping workloads, creating business cases, and reviewing technical assessments.

## Actions

* Review the Azure Migrate project overview and resolve Action Center data quality alerts.
* Group related workloads into the ContosoUniversity application, including metadata like type, criticality, and complexity.
* Build a scoped business case with discounts, regions, and workload selections, then interpret the cost and CO₂ outputs.
* Open existing business cases and assessments to compare costs, strategies, readiness states, software inventory, and compliance posture.
* Answer knowledge checks such as powered-off Linux VMs, Windows Server 2016 counts, and ContosoUniversity cost/savings figures.

* You understand data quality impacts and have addressed flagged issues.
* You successfully grouped ContosoUniversity workloads with appropriate metadata.
* You created and interpreted a business case highlighting ROI, cost savings, and emissions reductions.
